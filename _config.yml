  I was admitted to Nanjing University in September 2015 and received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Technology department of Nanjing University in June 2019. In the same year, I was admitted to study for a PhD degree led by [Prof. Fengyuan Xu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/fxu/index.htm) in Nanjing University without entrance examination. [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nec2b_oAAAAJ) and [Github](https://github.com/schenglee).
